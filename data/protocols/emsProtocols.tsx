        <p>
          Key considerations for Abdominal Pain include patient alertness,
          pregnancy status for females of childbearing age, fainting/syncope,
          pain characteristics (especially ripping/tearing pain that may
          indicate aortic issues), and pain location.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Pay special attention to age and gender factors, as they significantly
          impact determinant selection. For example, males over 35 with pain
          above the navel may require a higher response level due to increased
          cardiac risk.

          older adults often signals greater risk, especially for cardiac or

          and pain description to guide response escalation. Groin/testicular

        <p>
          When handling Allergic Reactions, assess for signs of airway
          involvement and consciousness first. Ineffective or agonal breathing
          is treated as a true emergency requiring the highest response level.
          If the patient is not alert, or is having trouble speaking between
          breaths, escalate immediately.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2">
          Difficulty breathing or swallowing—especially in a patient with a
          known history of severe reactions—suggests airway compromise and
          should never be underestimated. Consider whether the patient has used
          an injection (e.g., EpiPen) or taken medications; this may affect
          sub-code selection but does not rule out severity. Prior reactions
          often mean increased risk of rapid progression.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2">
          Note what caused the reaction. Insect stings, spider bites, or snake
          bites may trigger systemic symptoms and need appropriate coding. A
          swarming attack (e.g., multiple stings) is always treated as a
          higher-priority event due to increased toxin load and the risk of
          rapid deterioration. Time of onset, known allergy history, and any
          treatment taken so far should all be captured to guide proper
          determinant selection.

        <p>
          Animal Bite calls must be evaluated based on immediate danger, the
          type of animal involved, and the severity and location of injuries. If
          the attack is still in progress, dispatch must prioritize responder
          safety and scene control. Multiple animals, large or exotic species,
          or a mauling scenario always elevate the response.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2">
          Breathing issues, unconsciousness, or bites to critical areas such as
          the head, neck, or chest require urgent response due to the risk of
          airway compromise, bleeding, or traumatic complications. The
          dispatcher should also note the patient's alertness and whether
          bleeding is present or uncontrolled.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-2">
          Finally, determine when the incident occurred and where the animal is
          now. Delayed incidents without priority symptoms may be downgraded,
          while unknowns about the animal's location, time of bite, or patient
          status should err toward caution. Law enforcement involvement is
          typically required for ongoing threats or when dangerous animals are
          uncontained.
